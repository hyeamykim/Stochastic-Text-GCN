# Stochastic-Text-GCN

For the Research project on Stochastic TextGCN for large scale datasets (project repository: https://github.com/yelloejp/StochasticTextGCN) that I worked on, I prepared some Google Colab Notebook to try out GraphSAINT algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04931) with different large scale datasets such as Yelp, Amazon, and Reddit, all of which are imported from PyTorchGeometric (https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric).
